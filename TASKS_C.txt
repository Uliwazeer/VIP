				Importance Of HEXADECIMAL
It's a system start from [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F].
Usages Are
1-Adresses In Memory
2-Colors Codes
3-More Readably Than Binary Codes
4-MCU Programming

***********************************************************
								1-Compiler  & Interpreter
								2-Scripting & Programming
								3-Framework & Library
***********************************************************
Interpreter	
					
Translates program one statement at a time.			
Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.		
Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby use interpreters.	
***********************************************************
Compiler

Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient.
Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.

			What Happened When You Divide On Zero [/0]...??
1-Compiler Excuite code and processor find there Divided by 0 and stop this process and make in ifinite loop
2-craching and Hanging in CPU
3-most implementations use the IEEE 754 standard, where division by 0 is well defined. 
4-0 / 0 gives a well defined result of NaN (not-a-number)
5-x / 0 for x â‰  0 gives either +Infinity or -Infinity, depending on the sign of x.
6-In languages like C, C++ etc. division by zero invokes undefined behaviour
7-Many processors have some kind of built-in "divide" instruction, which will behave differently depending on the processor. 
On Intel 32bit and 64 bit processors, 
the "divide" instructions will crash your application when you try to divide by zero. Other processors may behave differently.

If a compiler detects that a division by zero will happen when you execute some code, and the compiler is nice to its users, 
it will likely give you a warning, and generate a built-in "divide" instruction so that the behaviour is the same.
